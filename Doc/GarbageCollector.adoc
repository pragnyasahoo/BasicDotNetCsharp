= Garbage Collector
 
 ** Finalize gets called by the GC when this object is no longer in use.
 ** Dispose is just a normal method which the user of this class can call to release any resources.
 
 ** If user forgot to call Dispose and if the class have Finalize implemented then GC will make sure it gets called.

|**Finalize**| **Dispose **
|It is a method of Object class.|It is implemented as part of the IDisposable interface.
|Finalize is responsible for cleaning of the unmanaged resources like Files, DB connections, COM etc. held by object before that the object is destroyed |Dispose can release unmanaged resources like Files, DB connections, COM etc. at any time
|Dispose can release unmanaged resources like Files, DB connections, COM etc. at any time |It is the users' responsibility to call the Dispose method explicitly.
|It has performance cost as GC has to visit Finalize twice|It has performance cost as GC has to visit Finalize twice
|Recommended it when you have unmanaged resources, and want to make sure about these resources to be freed when the Garbage collection happens|Recommended it when your class users get facility to free resources.
|The method finalize( ) is to be implemented for unmanaged resources.|The method dispose( ) is to be implemented whenever there is a close( ) method.
|The method finalize( ) is declared as private.|The method dispose( ) is declared as public.
|The method finalize is slower as compared to dispose|The method dispose( ) is faster and instantly disposes an object.
|protected void finalize( ){
// finalization code here
}|public void Dispose( ){
// Dispose code here
}
|It's implemented with the help of destructor in C#.
|It's implemented by implementing IDisposable interface Dispose() method
|Internally, it is called by Garbage Collector and cannot be called by user code.|Explicitly, it is called by user code and the class which is implementing dispose method, must has to implement IDisposable interface.
